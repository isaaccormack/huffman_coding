# huffman_encoding
ARM processor optimized implementation of Huffman Encoding Algorithm for SENG 440.


UPDATE THIS WITH MAKE for decoder and encoder and update tests and usage once implemented


## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/isaaccormack/huffman_encoding.git
```

2. Make the encoder and decoder
```
make
```

3. Run with a single input file
```
./a.out infile.txt
```

## Testing
Currently only testing of character count functionality is implemented. Navigate to the `test` folder and run
```
./test_char_count.sh  
```
